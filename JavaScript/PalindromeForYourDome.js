// A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements, whose meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction. Famous examples include "Amore, Roma", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" and "No 'x' in 'Nixon'". - wikipedia

// Our goal is to determine whether or not a given string is a valid palindrome or not.

// Like the above examples, here are a few test cases which are also populated:

// "Amore, Roma" => valid
// "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" => valid
// "No 'x' in 'Nixon'" => valid
// "Abba Zabba, you're my only friend" => invalid
// You can see that they are case insensitive and disregards non alphanumeric characters. In addition to a few predefined tests, your function will also be tested against a random string generator 50 times which are guaranteed to produce valid palindromes.

function palindrome(string) {
  return string.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z]/g, '').split('').every(function (letter, pos, sanitized) {
    return letter === sanitized[sanitized.length - pos - 1];
  });
}
